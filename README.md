# springboot-employee-manager-backend (Spring Boot + PostgreSQL)
A full-stack-ready, backend-focused Employee Management System built using Spring Boot and PostgreSQL. Features RESTful APIs for employee and department management, with clean code and expansion-ready structure aimed at learning, internships, and future security implementation. 


# Employee Manager Backend

A hands-on Employee & Department management backend system, created as part of my 4th year journey as a Computer Science student.  
This project focuses on clean code practices, RESTful design, and practical database integration. Itâ€™s a work-in-progress, with future plans for security modules!

---

##  Tech Stack & Key Features

- Spring Boot (Java 17+)
- PostgreSQL integration (replaces H2 for real-world skills)
- RESTful CRUD APIs for Employee and Department
- Modular code structure: Controllers, Services, Repositories, DTOs
- Exception handling and validation
- Ready for future enhancement: Security (Spring Security soon!)

---

##  Why This Project?

I built this as a way to:
- Deepen my backend development skills (especially Spring Boot ecosystem)
- Step up from in-memory (H2) to real relational DBs (Postgres)
- Prepare for internships and fresher tech roles (5-6 LPA target)
- Learn project documentation (README, code comments, structured commits)
- Have a strong, real-world project for my GitHub, resume, and interviews

##  Project Structure

- **/src/main/java/com/StackList/Week2/**  
  Organized by best practices with clear separation between entities, DTOs, controllers, and repositories.

- **/src/main/resources/**  
  Contains all DB configs (see application.properties for PostgreSQL)

---

##  How to Run

1. Setup PostgreSQL locally and create an `employee_management` database.
2. Update DB credentials in `/src/main/resources/application.properties`:
